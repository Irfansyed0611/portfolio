I built an automated Account Factory using Terraform to provision new AWS accounts with predefined security and governance guardrails. Integrated with a GitOps-driven CI/CD pipeline, it enabled self-service account creation on demand. This project helped me streamline the account provisioning process, eliminate repetitive manual tasks, and ensure that every new account was secure, compliant, and cost-optimized from day one.
